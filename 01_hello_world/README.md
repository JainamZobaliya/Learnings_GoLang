# Initialisation of GoLang Project

1. Create a file `main.go`
2. Run command `go mod init [module-path]`, in our case `go mod init hello` <br>
The go mod init command  (Similar to npm init) initializes and writes a new go.mod file (Similar to package.json file) in the current directory, in effect creating a new module rooted at the current directory. The go.mod file must not already exist.
3. To Execute the Hello World Program, run `go run main.go`
